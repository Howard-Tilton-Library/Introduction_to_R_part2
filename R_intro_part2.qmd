Welcome! This tutorial was commissioned by Tulane Universityâ€™s Howard-Tilton Memorial Library as the second half of an introduction to R workshop. 
It is targeted towards faculty, post-docs, graduate students, and undergraduates new to R. 
In part I, you learned the fundamentals of R and built a foundation for working with your own data. In this second installment, you'll learn to streamline project management, incorporate packages to increase functionality, code more efficiently in the "tidy" dialect, implement more complex conditional processes, summarize and analyze your data, and visualize your data with figures.

Happy coding!
